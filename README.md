The primary source of the data will be a comprehensive dataset obtained by Box Office Mojo, which includes cumulative and average gross revenue by quarter, holiday and month from 2020 to 2024, as well as the top-grossing films in the US, Australia and China during that period. This historical data is scraped, cleaned, and structured to provide a solid foundation for our investigations (Box Office Mojo, 2024).
